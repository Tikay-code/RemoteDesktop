# RemoteDesktop
a remote desktop software (not a GUI one ):)

This project is like a reverse-shell.
when the client is connecting to the server we can do bunch of things, like:

password = See all target passwords
screenshot = Taking a screenshot
ls = See all files and firs in the active directory
remove = Remove a file
search = See files and dirs in path
copy = Copying file from client to server
send = Send File From The Server To The Client
disconnect = Disconnect
help - show all commands

Spoiler? my fav command is the password command (:)
